    <p> This app takes a list of CorrelationMatrices and criteria as input and creates a CorrelationMatrix object
    as output along with displaying a report.</p>

    <p> There are three main options the user can search for: </p>

    <p>     <b>Unique:</b> returns interactions that ONLY meet the 'Correlation' and 'Significance' cutoff criteria  in
                the specified, 'Unique To This Matrix', matrix.</p>

    <p>     <b>Union:</b> returns ALL interactions that meet the 'Correlation' and Significance' cutoff criteria.</p>

    <p>     <b>Intersection:</b> returns the interactions the meet the 'Correlation' and Significance' cutoff criteria
                for a specified number, 'Frequency', of matrices.</p>
