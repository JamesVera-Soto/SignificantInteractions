    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p> The purpose of this app is to find interactions that meet a given criteria throughout multiple CorrelationMatrices.
    This helps users see what organisms interact which each other over a period of time. Interactions are considered to
    meet the criteria in a matrix if the interaction’s correlation value is higher than the ‘Correlation Cutoff’, and, if
    ‘Significance Cutoff’ is specified, the interaction’s significance value has to be lower than the ‘Significance Cutoff’.
    There are three different searches the user can specify—Unique, Union, and Intersection. Each search is described in
    more detail below. </p>

    <p>Note that at least one, ‘Correlation Cutoff’ OR ‘Significance Cutoff’ must be specified.</p>

    <p><b>Required:<b/></p>

    <p>1)	List of CorrelationMatrix’s: Add multiple CorrelationMatrices.</p>

    <p>2)	Correlation Cutoff: an interaction between one OTU and another OTU is considered to meet the correlation
    cutoff criteria if its correlation value is greater than the specified cutoff.</p>

    <p>AND/OR</p>

    <p>3)	Significance Cutoff: an interaction between one OTU and another OTU is considered to meet the significance
    cutoff criteria if its significance value is less than the specified cutoff. Note that not every CorrelationMatrix
    has significance data. If no significance data is found in a matrix upon running the app, any specified significance
    cutoff will be ignored for the remainder of the run. </p>

    <p>4)	Search for:</p>

    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">•	Unique: This search option looks for interactions that ONLY meet the
    ‘Correlation Cutoff’ and/or ‘Significance Cutoff’ for one specified matrix. If an interaction is found to meet the
    criteria in another matrix, that interaction will be dropped from the result. To specify a matrix, the user has to
    choose one from the ‘Unique To This Matrix’ criteria.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">•	Union: This search keeps track of all interactions that meet the
    ‘Correlation Cutoff’ and/or ‘Significance Cutoff’ criteria regardless of which matrix it is or in how many matrices
    it met the criteria in.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">•	Intersection: This search starts out by keeping track of all interactions
    regardless if they meet the criteria or not. In matrices where the interaction met the criteria, a frequency value for
    that interaction gets incremented. After analyzing the last matrix, it then starts removing interactions that did not
    meet the ‘Frequency for Intersection’ criteria, returning only interactions that met the ‘Correlation Cutoff’ and/or
    ‘Significance Cutoff’ criteria for ‘frequency’ number of matrices.</p>

    <p>5)	Output CorrelationMatrix Name: Specify name of output CorrelationMatrix.</p>

    <p><b>Required depending on Search for type:</b></p>

    <p>6)	Unique To This Matrix: If the user chooses the ‘Unique’ search for option, this field is where they choose which
    matrix they want the exclusive interactions to come from. If ‘Unique’ is chosen and this field is left blank, the app will
    default the first matrix in the list as the unique matrix.</p>

    <p>7)	Frequency for Intersection: If the user chooses the ‘Intersection’ search for option, this criterion indicates
    the number of matrices that an interaction has to meet the ‘Correlation Cutoff’ and/or ‘Significance Cutoff’ criteria
    in order to be in the results.</p>

    <p><b>Information About The Output Matrix:</b></p>

    <p><b>Unique:</b></p>

    <p>•	Output matrix contains the correlation and significance(if present) values that the passing interactions had
    in the specified matrix they exclusively passed in.</p>

    <p><b>Union & Intersection:</b></p>

    <p>•	Output matrix contains the AVERAGE correlation and significance(if present) values—adds up the values then
    divides by number of matrices. If an interaction is present in one matrix and absent in another, it gets a 0 value
    where it is absent. </p>

    <p>Significance data is added to the output matrix if it was present in the matrices provided in the list.</p>

    <p>Frequency data is also added to the output matrix.</p>

    <p>Because of the structure of a CorrelationMatrix, some interactions that did not make the results will still show
    up in the output matrix and are required to have a numeric value when stored in a CorrelationMatrix. Those interactions
    are given a ‘correlation value’ of 0 and a ‘significance value’ of 1.</p>
